##### This Code Allows a User to Grow a Tree in Their Browser
    The user must have their browser console open to view the tree.
    Once you have selected a height for the tree and the character you
    want to build it with, you may hit the "enter" key or simply click
    on the "Grow Your Tree" button.

##### Example

Here's what the pine tree should look like when you specify a height of 7, and use the asterisk character.

```js
      *
     ***
    *****
   *******
  *********
 ***********
*************
```
